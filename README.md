# Upbeat - Accessible Music Education For All

An AI-powered music learning platform that makes music education accessible to everyone, anywhere, anytime. Built on Google's Gemini AI, it offers real-time, personalized instruction that adapts to your skill level and learning pace, breaking down barriers to music education.

## Project Description

**Upbeat** is a revolutionary AI-powered music education platform that democratizes access to quality music instruction. Using advanced computer vision and real-time audio processing, the platform provides personalized piano tutoring that can see your hands, hear your playing, and offer instant feedback‚Äîjust like having a personal music teacher available 24/7.

The platform features interactive avatars with unique personalities (inspired by Harry Potter characters), real-time visual feedback, and step-by-step song teaching that adapts to each learner's pace and skill level.

## Problem

Traditional music education faces significant barriers:

- **Geographic Limitations**: Quality music teachers are often concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural communities underserved
- **Cost Barriers**: Private music lessons can cost $50-100+ per hour, making them inaccessible to many families
